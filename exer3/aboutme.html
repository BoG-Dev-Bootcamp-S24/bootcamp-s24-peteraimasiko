                <p class="text-white">Play guitar when he has free time. Music is has been his passion for years. Without it
                    he wouldn't know where he would be. He likes to play the piano as well. He is wanting a new guitar because his current guitar is hard to play.

                <p class="text-white">Play PC games online. Peter Has been playing games on internet since he was young. Some of the games he has played the most are
                    Minecraft, Roblox, Valorant, CS:GO, and Fornite (He is not very proud of that last one). While he has recently been busy and hasn't had much time to play games
                    consistently, some of his favorite games now are Deepwoken on Roblox and Valorant. Sometime in the near future he is planning to make his own games on Roblox using their game engine.
                    It has been a dream of his since he first started playing.
                </p>

                <p class="text-white">Crochet, make 3D models, and read. Lately, he has been looking for another relaxing activity he could indulge in. One day, he was scrolling through
                    pinterest and saw really cool crochet designs and patterns. Thats when he decide he should pick it up for himself. Peter mostly is making 3D models for his game that his making but 
                    he would also like in future to do freelancing for other games and projects when he gets good at it. Reading was always something he wanted to get back into after high school, so he has starting reading a few books now. He has finished like 5 manga 
                    within the span of high school to now so lol.
